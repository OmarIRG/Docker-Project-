React Docker Solution
Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a simple ReactJS application and containerize it using Docker. The solution includes a Dockerfile optimized with multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size.
This repository contains a simple ReactJS application that is containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds to create a lightweight production-ready image of the React app served by Nginx.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
Docker Setup
This project includes a Dockerfile to containerize the React app:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

```bash
docker build -t my-react-app .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 my-react-app
```

This command maps port 80 in the container to port 3000 on your local machine.

3. **Access the App:**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the running application.
Usage
### Building the Docker Image
You can build the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-react-app .
```

### Running the Docker Container
```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 my-react-app
```

This command maps the container's port 80 to your machine's port 3000, allowing you to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
